# App Team

### Level 1

This application will aim at helping its users by converting the units from one\
another. This app will take input from the user and convert it to the desired\
unit and give the result. For example, it will be able to convert a value in\
centimeters to Meters or grams to kilograms and vice versa.

To develop this application, Android Studio is required. The knowledge of\
XML would be required for the user interface and the Java programming for\
the application’s conversion functionality.

### Level 2

This application as the name suggests will be a To-Do list holding app. It’ll\
store the users schedules and their upcoming meetings or events. In this\
application, users will be enabled to write their important notes as well. To\
make it safe, provide a login page before the user can access it.

So, this app will have a login page, sign-up page, logout system, and the area\
to write their tasks, events, or important notes. You can build it in android\
studio using Java and XML at ease. Using XML you can build the user\
interface as user-friendly as you can. And to store the users’ data, you can\
use SQLite enabling the users to even delete the data permanently.



### Level 3

Here you can provide the users with Quiz on various general knowledge\
topics. These practices will ensure that you’re able to set the layouts properly\
and slowly increase your pace of learning the Android application\
development. In this you’ll learn to use various Layout components at the\
same time understanding them better.

In the app, questions would be asked and answers would be shown as\
multiple choices. The user selects the answer and gets shown on the screen\
if the answers are correct. In the end the final marks would be shown to the\
users.
